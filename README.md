# As a parking spot's customer price grows, does its convenience increase?

By [Didier Catz](https://didiercatz.com)

#### For this project, a few assumptions will be made. _Convenience_ in this case means how convenient a spot is for the customer â€” e.g. is it cheap? Are there enough parking spots? Is it easily accessible? _How much comfort does it bring to the customer?_

## An interactive data visualisation on Dutch parking data.

In collaboration with the Volkskrant, a Dutch news outlet focused on objective and neutral-standpoint news, I will be creating an interactive datavisualisation regarding parking in the city. I want to measure and define convenience and see if a parking spot's cost positively or negatively influences this convenience.
