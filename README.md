# As a parking spot's cost grows, does its convenience increase?

## An interactive data visualisation on Dutch parking data.

In collaboration with the Volkskrant, a Dutch news outlet focused on objective and neutral-standpoint news, I will be creating an interactive datavisualisation regarding parking in the city. I want to measure and define convenience and see if a parking spot's cost positively or negatively influences this convenience.
